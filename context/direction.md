## 2. **Goals and Outcomes**

1. **Inform Citizens:** Provide transparent access to essential goods prices across multiple local markets.
2. **Visualize Trends:** Show price trends to allow better budgeting decisions.
3. **Demonstrate CRUD Functionality:** Simulate a real-world backend interaction where users can add, edit, or delete market items.
4. **Bilingual Accessibility:** Include a toggle between English and Khmer, reflecting local context.
5. **Walkthrough Ready:** Ensure all features are functional and visually coherent for a school assignment demo.

### **Phase 3 – Design & User Experience (Days 11–12)**

* **UI Polishing:** Apply TailwindCSS for consistent styling, spacing, and readability.
* **User-friendly Interactions:** Highlight success/failure feedback for CRUD, intuitive table/graph display.
* **Responsive Checks:** Desktop-first layout, but verify usability on smaller screens.

**Direction Focus:** Make the app **visually appealing, intuitive, and professional-looking**.

---

### **Phase 4 – Testing & Demo Preparation (Days 13–14)**

* **Full App Testing:** Verify all pages, CRUD, charts, and bilingual toggle.
* **Walkthrough Script:** Prepare a clear, step-by-step demo showcasing:

  * Home page price table
  * Market comparison
